Static Analysis

Static Analysis is the process used to extract data from a given binary file.
If a plugin is selected before Static Analysis is performed then the outcome will be the points of interest specified
by that plugin.
In order to perform Static Analysis on a binary it is important that a project exists or that one is created beforehand.

â€¢ Steps to Initialize Static Analysis:
    1) Select a project from the Project selection view.
    2) Press the Run Static Analysis button under the Analysis Control View.

Once the analysis is successfully completed the Points of Interest view will be populated with binary data extracted during static analysis.
