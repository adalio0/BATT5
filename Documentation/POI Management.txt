Point of Interest Management

Plugins created for BATT5 are primarily composed of Points of Interest (POI's) defined by the user. These POI's could be managed through the management tab of BATT5.

1) Go to the Management tab of BATT5.

2) Select the plugin which you want add POI(s) to.

3) Select "Browse" under "Add POIs to [selected plugin] Through XML Input".

4) Select an XML file which conforms to the POI schema (poiConfig.xsd). To see the schema, go to .../BATT5/src/Configurations/poiConfig.xsd.

5) Select "Save" in the same section. If the file selected is valid, new POI(s) will appear under "Point of Interest Management" on the left side of the window. Multiple POI's can be added to a plugin in this manner.

• To create a point of interest through manual input:

1) Go to the Management tab of BATT5.

2) Select the plugin which you want add POI(s) to.
