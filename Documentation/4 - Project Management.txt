Project Management

To create a new Project, a name, description, and path must be given in order to be created.

Path cannot receive input manually, path must be selected with browser and cannot be changed once project has been created.

Furthermore, you cannot create a project if the architecture of the Binary is not x86.

When Project Creation is performed, Project List will be populated with name of project and Project Properties will be populated with description, path, and binary properties uncovered by Radare.
