The Binary Analysis Tool by Team 5 (BATT5) is a reverse engineering tool meant to analyze 32-bit (x86) binary
(executable) files. Using Radare2, this tool uses Static Analysis to extract points of interests (functions, strings,
variables, and DLL's) and allows users to uncover attributes of these points of interest (POI's) through the use of
Dynamic Analysis.
