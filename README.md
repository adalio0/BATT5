The Binary Analysis Tool by Team 5 (BATT5) is a reverse engineering tool meant to analyze 32-bit (x86) binary
(executable) files. Using Radare2, this tool uses Static Analysis to extract points of interests (functions, strings,
variables, and DLL's) and allows users to uncover attributes of these points of interest (POI's) through the use of
Dynamic Analysis.<br>
<br>
The BATT5 system also the user to create and define plugins that filter specific POI's and extend the functionality of
BATT5. Users can create these plugins by using XML files that follow our XML schemas or by using the system's GUI.<br>
